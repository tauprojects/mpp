jmh-samples
===========
<b>NOTE: As of 15/06/2013 the jar/samples were up to date. JMH has come a long way since and is much easier to play with.<br/>
I have now removed the old jar/samples and use the maven hosted dependency instead.<br/></b>
JMH samples.<br/>
This was setup to support my 2 blog posts about JMH:<br/>
http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2013/05/using-jmh-to-benchmark-multi-threaded.html<br/>
http://psy-lob-saw.blogspot.com/2013/04/writing-java-micro-benchmarks-with-jmh.html<br/>
And contains the examples discussed under the psy.lob.saw package.<br/>
The JMH framework is hosted here: http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/<br/>
The JMH samples are a MUST read (and are always up to date): http://hg.openjdk.java.net/code-tools/jmh/file/tip/jmh-samples/src/main/java/org/openjdk/jmh/samples/<br/>
